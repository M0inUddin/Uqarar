## Installation

To install and set up the backend code, follow these steps:

1. Install Python and all the required libraries.
2. Install Jupyter Notebook to work with the `.ipynb` files.

## Genetic Algorithm API

The genetic algorithm API is implemented in the [geneticAPI.py](./api/geneticAPI.py) file. This API provides functions for running genetic algorithms and optimizing solutions based on the provided model.

## Model Training and Building

This directory also contains the code for model training and building. The model training and building code can be found in the `model` and `preprocessing` directories.
