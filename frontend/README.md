## Authentication & Database

For authentication and user data storage, we have used Firebase.

To set up Firebase, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Firebase website and create a new project.
2. In the Firebase console, click on "Authentication" in the left sidebar.
3. Enable the authentication methods you want to use, such as email/password, Google, or Facebook.
4. In the Firebase console, click on "Database" in the left sidebar.
5. Choose the Realtime Database or Firestore as your database solution.
6. Set up the database rules and indexes according to your application's requirements.
7. Copy the Firebase configuration code snippet provided by Firebase.
8. In this Flutter project, open the `pubspec.yaml` file and add the `firebase_core` and `firebase_auth` dependencies.
9. In this Flutter project, create/update a file called `firebase_config.dart` and paste the Firebase configuration code snippet.
10. Initialize Firebase in your Flutter app by calling `Firebase.initializeApp()` in your `main` function.
11. Use the Firebase authentication and database APIs to implement the desired functionality in your app.
